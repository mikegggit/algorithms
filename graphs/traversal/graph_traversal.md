Graph traversal
===============
Refers to algorithms for visiting vertices in a graph in a certain order.


Background
----------
### Spanning Tree
A subgraph S of some graph G where S is a tree, contains all vertices of G, and has the minimum possible edges to still satisfy containing all vertices of G.

Only relevant to a connected graph.

Used in Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Minimum Spanning Tree
A weighted spanning tree associated w/ an undirected connected graph G that connects all G's vertices w/o any cycles and with the minimum possible weight.


### Spanning Forest
Similar to a spanning tree, however composed of multiple spanning trees, each associated w/ a disconnected subgraph.

### Minimum Spanning Forest
