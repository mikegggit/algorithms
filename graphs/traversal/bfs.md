Breadth-First Search
====================
Navigates vertices of a graph in a way that moves level-by-level away from the root.  

General
-------
More complex implementation than DFS.

Typically preferred when trying to find a shortest path between two nodes.

Algorithm
---------
Not recursive.

Relies on a queue to maintain the next node to visit.
