Insertion Sort - Singly Linked List
===================================
Using insertion sort to sort a singly linked list.

Summary
-------
Not an in place sort.  

Requires another Linked List to hold the sorted representation.



Analysis
--------
Iterates over each element of source array.  

O(N)

For each element of source array, searches target array for insertion point.

=> O(N^2)


Unlike an array-based insertion sort, requires additional space to hold / build the sorted representation.
