Min / Max
=========
Algorithms for determining the min / max of a set of data

Algorithms
----------
Linear search
Recursive divide and conquer
Min / Max heap


Sorted structures
-----------------
If the source structure is already sorted, then the time complexity is O(1).

Sorting an input can be more expensive than using some other algorithm like simple linear search.

Linear search
-------------

Otherwise

Iteration is O(n)
Comparisons is O(n)
Assignment complexity varies depending on how input data is sorted.
In the best case, the data is sorted in increasing order and the min is the first item in the data and only one min assignment is required.

Best case is 



Min / Max heap
--------------
Building a heap is more expensive than simply scanning a list of items
